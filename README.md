# SwiftMemory
A simple memory game app, written in Swift.
*Apologies for the name 'Test', originally the project was just a test but it turned into a full game.*
Most of the code is from a [series of Stanford lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbtqIBpUG7g&feature=youtu.be), but I have added some functionality on my own.
Shuffling the cards, the themes, the 'New Game' button, and some aspects of the View were written by me.
The main purpose of this project is to be an introduction to Swift, as well as Xcode.
